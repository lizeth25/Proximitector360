# Proximitector360

This project was initially inspired by the way in which we perceive the world around us, specifically how our eyes determine the proximity of an object. We decided that not only would we detect the distance of an object using proximity sensors, but we would also use that information to communicate back with the user and let them be able to feel how far an object is through the use of vibration motors, which would vibrate weakly or strongly depending on how far away an object was to the sensor that it was paired up with. Using various sensors in a hat and motors directly next to the sensors would allow the user to feel the world around them, which would be useful for people who cannot see.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Arduino
Materials Listed in Bill of Materials

## Running the tests

Run the code in our proximitector code file once all the sensors and motors are connected.
Our installation and code can be found in the final project report and in the videos/images folder.
